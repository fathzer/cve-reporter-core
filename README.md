# cve-reporter-core
Building blocks to report vulnerabilities found in projects contained in a repository.

It currently supports only Gitlab repository and Maven projects.
The only vulnerability tested is Log4J shell ... but the architecture of the project allows to add more repositories (GitHub, SVN, etc...), build engines (Gradle) and vulnerabilities (for instance using a CVE data base).

## Why this project?
When Log4J shell vulnerability was discovered, I was responsible for more than a hundred of projects in a company that uses a private Gitlab repository.  
I wondered how to list all my impacted projects.  
Of course, if I had used best practices, I would have use a pipeline for all my projects to have dependabot running on them. But nobody's perfect ;-)

So, I could have created a Gitlab CI script in all of my projects to run dependabot. And maybe miss some projects ... and for sure leave the vulnerability exposed for a while (until I created all my scripts).  
I also wondered how I could help my colleagues ... without touching their projects?

Finally, I found the fastest way was to have an application to list all the vulnerability occurrences found in one's project. Free to him to fix it ... or not.  
As I did not find anyone, I decided to create one on my free time.


## How to use it

** Prerequisites:**
- Have Java 8+ installed on the machine that runs this program.
- For Maven support: Have Maven installed on the machine that runs this program. The user's settings.xml should be configured to access the artifact repository (Maven Central or your company private repository). You can test Maven is successfully installed using *mvn -version* command.




Where *outputFile* is the path of a csv file that will contain the result of the inspection.
- First column will contain the project path
- Second column will contain its status:
  - OK: No vulnerability detected.
  - NOT_THIS_BUILDER: The project is not a Maven project.
  - NOT_SUPPORTED: The project build scheme is not supported (currently, it should never happen - This is reserved for, for instance, partial Gradle support).
  - BUILD_ERROR: An error occurred while looking for the project dependencies.
  - ALERT: A vulnerability has been detected. In such a case, a third column is added to list the detected problems.
